    description:
      "A non-invasive system that predicts Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) risk using stress signals captured via a GSR sensor, integrated with machine learning and real-time IoT monitoring.",
    subDescription: [
      [
  "Designed a desktop-based system that detects PCOS risk by analyzing stress levels and key health indicators.",
  "Used a GSR sensor with ESP32 to capture real-time stress signals, enabling dynamic physiological monitoring.",
  "Developed a Python-based GUI that interacts with a Flask API to predict PCOS risk and visualize stress feedback.",
  "Implemented a flexible backend that intelligently routes input data to the appropriate machine learning model.",
  "Achieved real-time feedback through serial communication between hardware and software components.",
  "Enabled early PCOS detection by combining stress metrics with predictive modeling for improved accuracy."
